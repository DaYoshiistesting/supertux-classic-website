    <h2>What is SuperTux Classic?</h2>
        <ul></ul><p></p> <!-- Very ugly hack, but to have a good space I have to keep it, to keep the settings of the OG Website. -->
            SuperTux Classic is a 2D platformer game where you play as a penguin in Antarctica.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is a complete remaster of the Milestone 1 version of SuperTux (versions 0.1.0 - 0.1.4) 
            created from the ground up in the Godot engine! 
            <br>
            <br>
            It features enhanced graphics, sounds, music, and gameplay, but retains the core design 
            reminiscent of classic platformer titles such as Super Mario Bros.
            <br>
            <br>
            The game is completely open source, being licensed under the GNU GPL.
            This means you can do whatever you like with the game's source files (under the license's conditions), 
            whether that's redistributing the game, making mods, re-skins, custom levels, you name it!

                    <h3>Fix game crash when trying to fight Nolok.</h3>
						<p></p>
							Fixed a bug where the final World 1 level "The Mighty Nolok" 
							crashes when you try to access it, making it impossible to beat the game.
						   (Removed Nolok's diabolical traps which take advantage of<br>
							Tux's ultra-fast speed ðŸ¤£).

                <h3>The level editor is finally here!</h3>
                <p>
                <b>An all-new, custom-built level editor has been added into SuperTux Classic!</b>
                <br>
                You can now make your own SuperTux Classic levels straight from within the game itself!
                <br>
                This editor is fully featured and supports all features within the game, with a few exceptions*.
                <br>
                <a href="Pictures/0_4_EDITOR.png"><img class="sshot" src="Pictures/0_4_EDITOR.png" width="700" height="380"/></a>
                <br>
                The editor was designed to be <b>as intuitive as possible to use</b>. 
                <br>
                If you would like to give feedback or suggestions on its design for future improvement, please join the 
                <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aJKXpakVFR">SuperTux Classic Discord Server</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The editor is also <b>completely usable on mobile devices</b>, with relevant adjustments being made to support touch controls.
                <br>
				</p>
                <b>New features also include:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A toggle for auto-run (you can choose to walk).</li>
                        <li>A huge restructuring of the game's internals to make way for the level editor.</li>
                        <li>Many bug fixes and optimisations (and probably new bugs to fix, given by the complexity of the new features ðŸ˜¬).</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                *The Level Editor does not currently support boss fights, teleporters in world maps, or scrolling text scenes for intros/outros of worlds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Happy SuperTuxing!! Enjoy the level editor - I can't wait to see what levels are made with it!

                        Huge thanks to Tlaloc1 for helping me port over these levels.

                <h3>This is mainly a tweak / bugfix release.</h3>
                    <p></p>
                        <b>This release finalizes the mobile support for SuperTux Classic. The game is now fully playable on mobile devices.</b>

                        This required changing the engine version of the game from Godot 3.4.4 to Godot 3.5.2, which brought with it a lot of bugs which needed to be fixed for the game to be stable again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can get SuperTux Classic for Android on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.supertuxclassic">Google Play Store</a>! (As well as simply downloading the APK).

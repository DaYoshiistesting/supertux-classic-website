# SuperTux Classic Website (not official)
Hello, this is the SuperTux Classic website entirely made by DaYoshiistesting.

It is based on the original [SuperTux website](https://www.supertux.org/index.html), on the [SuperTux Classic's source code](https://github.com/Alzter/SuperTux-Classic) and on the actual [website of SuperTux Classic](https://alzter-s.itch.io/supertux-classic).

# How to open the website
First, you'll need a web browser (you have one, since you are reading this readme on [github.com](https://github.com)).

Just double click on the home.html file and there you are. :)

# Other stuff I've did
I was also the main developper of [SuperTuxKart 0.6.3](https://github.com/DaYoshiistesting/stk-code-0.6.3), that I've abandonned due to personnal reasons.

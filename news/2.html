                    The boss may be moved to another world in the future - but for now it's in Bonus Island II.

                    I also introduced a bug where tux randomly dies 1% of the time apparently! ðŸ˜‚

                        All of the levels (and worldmap) from <b>Bonus Island II</b> have been added into SuperTux Classic, as well as many features that were not present which needed to be added for these levels.

                            <li>New tiles and tilesets, many of which are courtesy of RustyBox,</li>
                            <li>Many new backgrounds,</li>
                            <li>New music tracks, some of which were hand-restored.</li>
                            <li>Being able to hit more than one block at a time with your head.</li>
                            <li>Refactoring the save file system again (don't worry - this time your save files carry over),</li>

                            <br>
                            Bonus Island I is not added yet but will come later down the line.

        <h2><u>SuperTux Classic v0.2 is available!</u></h2>
            <ul></ul>
                <h3>Mobile Support is here!</h3>
                    <a href="../Pictures/0_2_0_SKY_LEVEL_WORLD_I.png"><img class="sshot" src="../Pictures/0_2_0_SKY_LEVEL_WORLD_I.png" width="700" height="340"/></a>

                        SuperTux Classic now has touch control support which will activate when using a touch screen or mobile device.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A few optimisations were also made to fix parts of the game which lagged previously on web and mobile devices, like the text scroll scenes.

        <h2><u>SuperTux Classic v0.1 is done!</u></h2>
            <ul></ul>
                <p>This is the big one.</p>
                    <h3>Worldmaps are here!</h3>
                        <a href="../Pictures/0_1_0_MAP_WORLD_I.png"><img class="sshot" src="../Pictures/0_1_0_MAP_WORLD_I.png" width="700" height="320"/></a>
                            <br>
                            Worldmaps have been added into SuperTux Classic. This makes it possible to revisit levels you have completed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            World 1's worldmap is fully complete.
                            <br>
                            Not all worldmap features from SuperTux (i.e. Teleporters) work yet - they will need to be implemented to add Bonus Island I and II.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The way save files are saved and loaded has also changed to accommodate world maps, so previous save files will no longer work with this update. 
                            <br>
                            You will need to create a new save file.

                                <li>Backgrounds which used large tilesets now use images instead.
                                This should improve performance a lot as now thousands less tiles will be rendering in levels which use the snow backgrounds.</li>

                    <h3>Fix game crash when trying to fight Nolok.</h3>
						<p></p>
							Fixed a bug where the final World 1 level "The Mighty Nolok" crashes when you try to access it, making it impossible to beat the game.
						   (Removed Nolok's diabolical traps which take advantage of Tux's ultra-fast speed ðŸ¤£).

            <ul></ul>
                <h3>The level editor is finally here!</h3>
                <p>
                <b>An all-new, custom-built level editor has been added into SuperTux Classic!</b>
                <br>
                You can now make your own SuperTux Classic levels straight from within the game itself!
                <br>
                This editor is fully featured and supports all features within the game, with a few exceptions*.
                <br>
                <a href="../Pictures/0_4_EDITOR.png"><img class="sshot" src="../Pictures/0_4_EDITOR.png" width="700" height="380"/></a>
                <br>
                The editor was designed to be <b>as intuitive as possible to use</b>. 
                <br>
                If you would like to give feedback or suggestions on its design for future improvement, please join the 
                <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aJKXpakVFR">SuperTux Classic Discord Server</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The editor is also <b>completely usable on mobile devices</b>, with relevant adjustments being made to support touch controls.
                <br>
				</p>
                <b>New features also include:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A toggle for auto-run (you can choose to walk).</li>
                        <li>A huge restructuring of the game's internals to make way for the level editor.</li>
                        <li>Many bug fixes and optimisations (and probably new bugs to fix, given by the complexity of the new features ðŸ˜¬).</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                *The Level Editor does not currently support boss fights, teleporters in world maps, or scrolling text scenes for intros/outros of worlds.
                <br>
                <br>
                Happy SuperTuxing!! Enjoy the level editor - I can't wait to see what levels are made with it!

                <h3>Bonus Island I is here!</h3>

                        <br>
                        There are 24 new levels you can play in Bonus Island I! Just watch out for the fish! And the lava! And maybe those spinning flame orbs!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Huge thanks to Tlaloc1 for helping me port over these levels.

        <h2><u>SuperTux Classic v0.3.4 is out!</u></h2>
            <ul></ul>
                <h3>This is mainly a tweak / bugfix release.</h3>
                    <p></p>
                        <b>This release finalizes the mobile support for SuperTux Classic. The game is now fully playable on mobile devices.</b>

                        <br>
                        This required changing the engine version of the game from Godot 3.4.4 to Godot 3.5.2, which brought with it a lot of bugs which needed to be fixed for the game to be stable again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can get SuperTux Classic for Android on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.godotengine.supertuxclassic">Google Play Store</a>! (As well as simply downloading the APK).
